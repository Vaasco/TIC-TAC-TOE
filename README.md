# TIC-TAC-TOE
I was challenge by my friends to do a tic-tac-toe game in kotlin in one afternoon.
Specifications of the game:

-Pvp tic-tac-toe with the classic tic-tac-toe rules.

-Requires some input (name, symbol).


The code was done a bit way to rushed(because i had to do it in one afternoon) as it as some features that i would like to change:

1-Global variables and some local ones.

2-Repetition of code.

3-Some of the cycles(while).

4-Organization of the code itself.

Now i will have more time to develop the project following some programming principles that weren't folowed in this first version, though it was a great learning opportunity to develop my kotlin skills.
